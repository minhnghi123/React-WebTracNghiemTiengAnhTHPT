              Travelling around Thailand in the 1990s, William Janssen was
              impressed with the basic rooftop solar heating systems that were
              on many homes, where energy from the sun was absorbed by a plate
              and then used to heat water for the home. Two decades later
              Janssen developed that basic idea he saw in south-east Asia into a
              portable device that uses the power from the sun to purify water.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
              The Desolenator operates as a mobile desalination unit that can
              take water from different places, such as the sea, rivers,
              boreholes, and rain, and purify <strong><u>it</u></strong> for
              human consumption. It is particularly valuable in regions where
              natural groundwater reserves have been polluted, or where seawater
              is the only water source available. Janssen saw that there was a
              need for a sustainable way to clean water for both the developing
              and the developed countries when he moved to the United Arab
              Emirates and saw large-scale water processing.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
              The Desolenator can produce 15 liters of drinking water per day,
              enough to sustain a family for cooking and drinking. Its main
              <strong><u>selling point</u></strong> is that unlike standard
              desalination techniques, it doesn't require a generated power
              supply; just sunlight. It measures 120 cm by 90 cm, and it's easy
              to transport, thanks to its two wheels. Water enters through a
              pipe and flows as a thin film between a sheet of double glazing
              and the surface of a solar panel, where it is heated by the sun.
              The warm water flows into a small boiler (heated by a
              solar-powered battery) where it is converted to steam. When the
              steam cools, it becomes <strong><u>distilled</u></strong> water.
              The device has a very simple filter to trap particles, and this
              can easily be shaken to remove them. A recent analysis found that
              at least two- thirds of the world's population lives with severe
              water scarcity for at least a month every year. Janssen says that
              by 2030 half of the world's population will be living with water
              stress - where the demand exceeds the supply over a certain period
              of time. It is really important that a sustainable solution is
              brought to the market that is able to help these people,' he says.
              'Many countries don't have the money for desalination plants,
              which are very expensive to build. They don't have the money to
              operate them, they are very maintenance intensive, and they don't
              have the money to buy the diesel to run the desalination plants,
              so it is a really bad situation."

              Travelling around Thailand in the 1990s, William Janssen was
              impressed with the basic rooftop solar heating systems that were
              on many homes, where energy from the sun was absorbed by a plate
              and then used to heat water for the home. Two decades later
              Janssen developed that basic idea he saw in south-east Asia into a
              portable device that uses the power from the sun to purify water.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
              The Desolenator operates as a mobile desalination unit that can
              take water from different places, such as the sea, rivers,
              boreholes, and rain, and purify <strong><u>it</u></strong> for
              human consumption. It is particularly valuable in regions where
              natural groundwater reserves have been polluted, or where seawater
              is the only water source available. Janssen saw that there was a
              need for a sustainable way to clean water for both the developing
              and the developed countries when he moved to the United Arab
              Emirates and saw large-scale water processing.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
              The Desolenator can produce 15 liters of drinking water per day,
              enough to sustain a family for cooking and drinking. Its main
              <strong><u>selling point</u></strong> is that unlike standard
              desalination techniques, it doesn't require a generated power
              supply; just sunlight. It measures 120 cm by 90 cm, and it's easy
              to transport, thanks to its two wheels. Water enters through a
              pipe and flows as a thin film between a sheet of double glazing
              and the surface of a solar panel, where it is heated by the sun.
              The warm water flows into a small boiler (heated by a
              solar-powered battery) where it is converted to steam. When the
              steam cools, it becomes <strong><u>distilled</u></strong> water.
              The device has a very simple filter to trap particles, and this
              can easily be shaken to remove them. A recent analysis found that
              at least two- thirds of the world's population lives with severe
              water scarcity for at least a month every year. Janssen says that
              by 2030 half of the world's population will be living with water
              stress - where the demand exceeds the supply over a certain period
              of time. It is really important that a sustainable solution is
              brought to the market that is able to help these people,' he says.
              'Many countries don't have the money for desalination plants,
              which are very expensive to build. They don't have the money to
              operate them, they are very maintenance intensive, and they don't
              have the money to buy the diesel to run the desalination plants,
              so it is a really bad situation."

              Travelling around Thailand in the 1990s, William Janssen was
              impressed with the basic rooftop solar heating systems that were
              on many homes, where energy from the sun was absorbed by a plate
              and then used to heat water for the home. Two decades later
              Janssen developed that basic idea he saw in south-east Asia into a
              portable device that uses the power from the sun to purify water.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
              The Desolenator operates as a mobile desalination unit that can
              take water from different places, such as the sea, rivers,
              boreholes, and rain, and purify <strong><u>it</u></strong> for
              human consumption. It is particularly valuable in regions where
              natural groundwater reserves have been polluted, or where seawater
              is the only water source available. Janssen saw that there was a
              need for a sustainable way to clean water for both the developing
              and the developed countries when he moved to the United Arab
              Emirates and saw large-scale water processing.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
              The Desolenator can produce 15 liters of drinking water per day,
              enough to sustain a family for cooking and drinking. Its main
              <strong><u>selling point</u></strong> is that unlike standard
              desalination techniques, it doesn't require a generated power
              supply; just sunlight. It measures 120 cm by 90 cm, and it's easy
              to transport, thanks to its two wheels. Water enters through a
              pipe and flows as a thin film between a sheet of double glazing
              and the surface of a solar panel, where it is heated by the sun.
              The warm water flows into a small boiler (heated by a
              solar-powered battery) where it is converted to steam. When the
              steam cools, it becomes <strong><u>distilled</u></strong> water.
              The device has a very simple filter to trap particles, and this
              can easily be shaken to remove them. A recent analysis found that
              at least two- thirds of the world's population lives with severe
              water scarcity for at least a month every year. Janssen says that
              by 2030 half of the world's population will be living with water
              stress - where the demand exceeds the supply over a certain period
              of time. It is really important that a sustainable solution is
              brought to the market that is able to help these people,' he says.
              'Many countries don't have the money for desalination plants,
              which are very expensive to build. They don't have the money to
              operate them, they are very maintenance intensive, and they don't
              have the money to buy the diesel to run the desalination plants,
              so it is a really bad situation."

              In the early 1990s, the psychologist K. Anders Ericsson and two
              colleagues installed themselves at Berlin's elite Academy of

              Sylvia Earle is an underwater explorer and marine biologist, who
              was born in the USA in 1935. She became interested in the world's
              oceans from an early age. As a child, she liked to stand on the
              beach for hours and look at the sea, wondering that it must be
              like under the surface. When she was 16, she finally got a chance
              to make her first dive. It was this dive that
              <strong><u>inspired</u></strong> her to become an underwater
              explorer. Since then, she has spent more than 6,500 hours under
              water, and has led more than seventy expeditions worldwide. She
              has also made the deepest dive ever, reaching a record-breaking
              depth of 381 meters.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
              In 1970, she became famous around the world when she became the
              captain of the first all-female team to live under water. The team
              spent two weeks in an underwater "house". The research they
              carried out showed the damage that pollution was causing to marine
              life, and specially to coral reefs. Since then she has written
              several books and magazine articles in which she suggests ways of
              reducing the damage that is being done to the world's oceans. One
              way, she believes, is to rely on fish farms for seafood, and
              reduce the amount of fishing that is done the out at sea.

              Sylvia Earle is an underwater explorer and marine biologist, who
              was born in the USA in 1935. She became interested in the world's
              oceans from an early age. As a child, she liked to stand on the
              beach for hours and look at the sea, wondering that it must be
              like under the surface. When she was 16, she finally got a chance
              to make her first dive. It was this dive that
              <strong><u>inspired</u></strong> her to become an underwater
              explorer. Since then, she has spent more than 6,500 hours under
              water, and has led more than seventy expeditions worldwide. She
              has also made the deepest dive ever, reaching a record-breaking
              depth of 381 meters.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
              In 1970, she became famous around the world when she became the
              captain of the first all-female team to live under water. The team
              spent two weeks in an underwater "house". The research they
              carried out showed the damage that pollution was causing to marine
              life, and specially to coral reefs. Since then she has written
              several books and magazine articles in which she suggests ways of
              reducing the damage that is being done to the world's oceans. One
              way, she believes, is to rely on fish farms for seafood, and
              reduce the amount of fishing that is done the out at sea.
